# Module 9 Challenge


## Background
----------------
This is a research project about people whom the company employed during the 1980s and 1990s. All that remains of the employee database from that period are six CSV files.

This project is to design the tables to hold the data from the CSV files, import the CSV files into a SQL database, and then answer questions about the data. The tasks are devided into three parts:

- Data Modeling

- Data Engineering

- Data Analysis
----------------------
### Data Modeling
